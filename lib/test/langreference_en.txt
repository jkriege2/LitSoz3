Hypatia (/haɪˈpeɪʃiə/ hy-PAY-sh(ee)ə or /haɪˈpætiə/ hy-PAT-ee-ə;[2] Greek: Ὑπατία Hypatía) (born c. AD 350 – 370; died 415[1][3]) was a mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher in Egypt, then a part of the Byzantine Empire.[4] She was the head of the Neoplatonic school at Alexandria, where she taught philosophy and astronomy.[5][6][7][8]

According to contemporary sources, Hypatia was murdered by a Christian mob after being accused of exacerbating a conflict between two prominent figures in Alexandria: the governor Orestes and the Bishop of Alexandria.[9]

Life

The mathematician and philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria was the daughter of the mathematician Theon Alexandricus (c. 335 – c. 405).[10] She was educated at Athens. Around AD 400, she became head of the Platonist school at Alexandria,[11][12][13] where she imparted the knowledge of Plato and Aristotle to students, including pagans, Christians, and foreigners.[4][14][15]

Although contemporary 5th-century sources identify Hypatia of Alexandria as a practitioner and teacher of the philosophy of Plato and Plotinus, two hundred years later, the 7th-century Egyptian Coptic bishop John of Nikiû identified her as a Hellenistic pagan and that "she was devoted at all times to magic, astrolabes and instruments of music, and she beguiled many people through her Satanic wiles".[16][17] However, not all Christians were as hostile towards her: some Christians even used Hypatia as symbolic of Virtue.[4] The contemporary Christian historiographer Socrates Scholasticus described her in Ecclesiastical History:
“ 	There was a woman at Alexandria named Hypatia, daughter of the philosopher Theon, who made such attainments in literature and science, as to far surpass all the philosophers of her own time. Having succeeded to the school of Plato and Plotinus, she explained the principles of philosophy to her auditors, many of whom came from a distance to receive her instructions. On account of the self-possession and ease of manner which she had acquired in consequence of the cultivation of her mind, she not infrequently appeared in public in the presence of the magistrates. Neither did she feel abashed in going to an assembly of men. For all men on account of her extraordinary dignity and virtue admired her the more.[4] 	”

—Socrates Scholasticus, Ecclesiastical History

Hypatia corresponded with former pupil Synesius of Cyrene, who was tutored by her in the philosophical school of Platonism and later became bishop of Ptolemais in AD 410, an exponent of the Christian Holy Trinity doctrine.[18] Together with the references by the pagan philosopher Damascius, these are the extant records left by Hypatia's pupils at the Platonist school of Alexandria.[19] The Byzantine Suda encyclopaedia reported that Hypatia was "the wife of Isidore the Philosopher" (apparently Isidore of Alexandria);[14] however, Isidore of Alexandria was not born until long after Hypatia's death, and no other philosopher of that name contemporary with Hypatia is known.[20] The Suda also stated that "she remained a virgin" and that she rejected a suitor with her menstrual rags, saying that they demonstrated that there is "nothing beautiful" about carnal desire—an example of a Christian source using Hypatia as a symbol of Virtue.[14][21][22]
Death
"Death of the philosopher Hypatia, in Alexandria" from Vies des savants illustres, depuis l'antiquité jusqu'au dix-neuvième siècle, 1866, by Louis Figuier.

Two widely cited but divergent texts describe the feud between Orestes, the prefect (or Governor) of Alexandria and Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria. The feud and the city-wide anger it provoked ultimately brought about the death of Hypatia. Kathleen Wider proposes that the murder of Hypatia marked the end of Classical antiquity,[23] and Stephen Greenblatt observes that her murder "effectively marked the downfall of Alexandrian intellectual life".[24] On the other hand, Christian Wildberg notes that Hellenistic philosophy continued to flourish in the 5th and 6th centuries, and perhaps until the age of Justinian.[25]
Scholasticus' account

One source, the Historia Ecclesiastica (or "Ecclesiastical History"), was written by Socrates Scholasticus (who was himself a Christian), some time shortly after Hypatia's death in AD 415. Scholasticus gives the more complete, less biased account of the feud between Orestes and Cyril and of the role Hypatia played in the feud that resulted in her death.

The other source, The Chronicle,[26] written by John of Nikiu in Egypt around 650 AD, demonizes Hypatia and Orestes directly, while validating all Christians involved in the events Nikiu describes. The Chronicle is more biased on the matter of the historical feud, omitting several points of the narrative that are included in Scholasticus's account.[27]

Orestes, the Roman governor of Alexandria, and Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria, were involved in a bitter feud in which Hypatia became one of the main points of contention. In 415 AD, the feud began over Jewish dancing exhibitions in Alexandria. Because the exhibitions attracted large crowds and were commonly prone to civil disorder of varying degrees, Orestes published an edict that outlined new regulations for such gatherings. When crowds gathered to read the edict shortly after it was posted in the city's theater, it angered Christians as well as Jews. At one such gathering, Hierax, a devout Christian follower of Cyril, read the edict and applauded the new regulations. Many people felt Hierax was attempting to incite the crowd into sedition. Orestes reacted swiftly and violently out of what Scholasticus suspected was "jealousy [of] the growing power of the bishops…[which] encroached on the jurisdiction of the authorities". He ordered Hierax to be seized and tortured publicly in the theater.

Hearing of Hierax's severe and public punishment, Cyril threatened to retaliate against the Jews of Alexandria with "the utmost severities" if the harassment of Christians did not cease immediately. In response to Cyril's threat, the Jews of Alexandria grew even more furious, eventually resorting to violence against the Christians. They plotted to flush the Christians out at night by running through the streets claiming that the Church of Alexander was on fire. When Christians responded to what they were led to believe was the burning down of their church, "the Jews immediately fell upon and slew them" by using rings to recognize one another in the dark and killing everyone else in sight. When the morning came, the Jews of Alexandria could not hide their guilt, and Cyril, along with many of his followers, took to the city's synagogues in search of the perpetrators of the massacre.

After Cyril rounded up all the Jews in Alexandria, he ordered them to be stripped of all possessions, banished them from Alexandria, and allowed their goods to be pillaged by the remaining citizens of Alexandria. With Cyril's banishment of the Jews, "Orestes [...] was filled with great indignation at these transactions, and was excessively grieved that a city of such magnitude should have been suddenly bereft of so large a portion of its population." Because of this, the feud between Cyril and Orestes intensified, and both men wrote to the emperor regarding the situation. Eventually, Cyril attempted to reach out to Orestes through several peace overtures, including attempted mediation and, when that failed, in an appeal to Orestes's allegiances as a Christian Roman,[28] showing the Gospels to him. Nevertheless, Orestes remained unmoved by such gestures.

Meanwhile, approximately 500 monks who resided in the mountains of Nitria, and who were "of a very fiery disposition", heard of the ongoing feud between the Governor and Bishop and descended into Alexandria armed and prepared to fight alongside Cyril. Upon their arrival, the monks intercepted Orestes's chariot and proceeded to bombard and harass him, calling him a pagan idolater. In response to such allegations, Orestes countered that he was actually a Christian and had even been baptized by Atticus, the Bishop of Constantinople. The monks paid little attention to Orestes's claims of Christianity, and one of the monks, Ammonius, struck Orestes in the head with a rock, causing him to bleed profusely. At this point, although Orestes's guards fled in fear, a nearby crowd of Alexandrians came to his aid. Ammonius was subsequently secured and ordered to be tortured for his actions. He died of the torture.

Following the death of Ammonius, Cyril ordered that he henceforth be remembered as a martyr. Such a proclamation did not sit well with "sober-minded" Christians, as Scholasticus pointed out, seeing that he "suffered the punishment due to his rashness he would not deny Christ". This fact, according to Scholasticus, became apparent to Cyril through general lack of enthusiasm for Ammonius's case for martyrdom.

Scholasticus then introduces Hypatia, the female philosopher of Alexandria and the woman who would become a target of the Christian anger that was inflamed during the feud. Daughter of Theon, and a teacher trained in the philosophical schools of Plato and Plotinus, she was admired by most for her dignity and virtue. Of the anger she provoked among Christians, Scholasticus writes, Hypatia ultimately fell "victim to the political jealousy which at the time prevailed". Orestes was known to seek her counsel, and a rumor spread among the Christian community of Alexandria blaming her for Orestes's unwillingness to reconcile with Cyril. A mob of Christians gathered, led by a reader (i.e., a minor cleric) named Peter, whom Scholasticus calls a fanatic. They kidnapped Hypatia on her way home and took her to the "Church called Caesareum. They then completely stripped her, and then murdered her with tiles." Socrates Scholasticus was hence interpreted as saying that, while she was still alive, Hypatia's flesh was torn off using oyster shells (tiles; the Greek word is ostrakois, which literally means "with or by oystershells"[29] but the word was also used for brick tiles on the roofs of houses and for pottery sherds). Afterward, the men proceeded to mutilate her and, finally, burn her limbs. News of Hypatia's murder provoked great public denouncement, not only against Cyril, but against the whole Alexandrian Christian community. Scholasticus closes with a lament: "Surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort."
The account given in the Chronicle of John of Nikiu

Bishop John of Nikiu, who lived several hundred years after the events he describes, writes bitterly of Hypatia, claiming that "she beguiled many people through (her) Satanic wiles".[30] Orestes, who Nikiu writes was himself a victim of Hypatia's demonic charm, regularly honored her and took to abandoning the Christian Church in order to follow her teachings more closely. Moreover, the Bishop claimed that Orestes himself persuaded others to leave the Church in favor of Hypatia's philosophical teachings and went as far as to host such "unbelievers" at his house.

One day, Orestes published an edict "regarding public exhibitions in the city of Alexandria" and all citizens gathered to read the edict. Cyril, curious to see why the edict caused such an uproar, sent Hierax, a "Christian possessing understanding and intelligence", who, although opposed to paganism, did as Cyril asked and went to learn the nature of Orestes's edict. Meanwhile, the Jews who gathered in anger over the edict believed that Hierax had come only for the sake of provocation (which, according to Scholasticus's text, was Hierax's intent). Upon this assumption, Orestes had Hierax punished for a crime for which "he was wholly guiltless".

For the punishment and torture of Hierax, as well as the death of several monks, including Ammonius, Cyril grew increasingly furious with Orestes. (Here, Nikiu blatantly ignores the assault on Orestes by the 500 monks, in which Ammonius played an active role in bringing about his own torture and death.) Cyril then warned the Jews against any further harm upon the Christians. However, with the support of Orestes (which is in no way implied by Scholasticus), the Jews felt confident in defying Cyril's authority, and so one night ran through the streets proclaiming: "The church of the apostolic Athanasius (Alexander) is on fire: come to its succour, all ye Christians." The Christians responded to the alarms only to be slaughtered by the Jews in a coordinated ambush.

The next morning, all remaining Christians of the town came to Cyril with news of the massacre, after which Cyril marched with them to purge the Jews from Alexandria. In so doing, Cyril allowed the pillaging of their possessions, and soon after purified all the synagogues in the city and made them into Churches (Scholasticus makes no mention of "purifying" the Synagogues). In the expulsion of the Jews, Orestes was unable to offer them any assistance.

Shortly thereafter, a group of Christians, under Peter the magistrate, went looking for Hypatia, the "pagan woman who had beguiled the people of the city and the prefect through her enchantments". They found her sitting in a chair, at which point they seized and brought her to "the great church, named Caesarion", where they proceeded to rip the clothes off her body. Then they dragged her through the streets of Alexandria until she died and burned her remains. Nikiu's description of Hypatia's death also differs from that of Scholasticus. Following the death of Hypatia, Bishop Cyril was named "the new Theophilus". With the death of Hypatia, Nikiu writes, the Christians had expelled the last remnant of pagan idolatry.

Yet even she fell a victim to the political jealousy which at that time prevailed. For as she had frequent interviews with Orestes, it was calumniously reported among the Christian populace that it was she who prevented Orestes from being reconciled to the bishop. Some of them, therefore, hurried away by a fierce and bigoted zeal, whose ringleader was a reader named Peter, waylaid her returning home and, dragging her from her carriage, they took her to the church called Caesareum, where they completely stripped her, and then murdered her with tiles. After tearing her body in pieces, they took her mangled limbs to a place called Cinaron, and there burnt them.[31]
		

And, in those days, there appeared in Alexandria a female philosopher, a pagan named Hypatia, and she was devoted at all times to magic, astrolabes, and instruments of music, and she beguiled many people through Satanic wiles . . . A multitude of believers in God arose under the guidance of Peter the Magistrate . . . and they proceeded to seek for the pagan woman who had beguiled the people of the city and the Prefect through her enchantments. And when they learnt the place where she was, they proceeded to her and found her . . . they dragged her along till they brought her to the great church, named Caesareum. Now this was in the days of the fast. And they tore off her clothing and dragged her . . . through the streets of the city till she died. And they carried her to a place named Cinaron, and they burned her body with fire.[16]
Works

No written work widely recognized by scholars as Hypatia's own has survived to the present time. Many of the works commonly attributed to her are believed to have been collaborative works with her father, Theon Alexandricus. This kind of authorial uncertainty is typical for female philosophers in antiquity.[32]

A partial list of Hypatia's works as mentioned by other antique and medieval authors or as posited by modern authors:

    A commentary on the 13-volume Arithmetica by Diophantus.[14]
    A commentary on the Conics of Apollonius.[14]
    Edited the existing version of Ptolemy's Almagest.[33]
    Edited her father's commentary on Euclid's Elements.[34]
    She wrote a text "The Astronomical Canon".[14] (Either a new edition of Ptolemy's Handy Tables or commentary on the aforementioned Almagest.)[35][36][37]

Her contributions to science are reputed to include the invention of the hydrometer,[38] used to determine the relative density (or specific gravity) of liquids. However, the hydrometer was invented before Hypatia, and already known in her time.[39][40]

Her student Synesius, bishop of Cyrene, wrote a letter describing his construction of an astrolabe.[41] Earlier astrolabes predate that of Synesius by at least a century,[42][43] and Hypatia's father had gained fame for his treatise on the subject.[44] However, Synesius claimed that his was an improved model.[45] Synesius also sent Hypatia a letter describing a hydrometer, and requesting her to have one constructed for him.[46]
Legacy
Late Antiquity to the Age of Reason
"Hypatia", at the Haymarket Theatre, January 1893

Shortly after her murder, there appeared under Hypatia's name a forged anti-Christian letter.[47] The Neoplatonist historian Damascius (c. 458 – c. 538) was "anxious to exploit the scandal of Hypatia's death", and attributed responsibility for her murder to Bishop Cyril and his Christian followers; that historical account is contained in the Suda.[48] Damascius's account of the Christian murder of Hypatia is the sole historical source attributing direct responsibility to Bishop Cyril.[49] Maria Dzielska proposes that the bishop's body guards might have murdered Hypatia.[50]

Some writers have theorized that the origin of the story of Saint Catherine was based on Hypatia.[51]

The intellectual Eudokia Makrembolitissa (1021–1096), the second wife of Byzantine Emperor Constantine X Doukas, was described by the historian Nicephorus Gregoras as a "second Hypatia".[52]

Centuries later, the early 18th-century deist scholar John Toland used the murder of Hypatia as the basis for the anti-Catholic tract Hypatia: Or the History of a most beautiful, most vertuous, most learned, and every way accomplish'd Lady; who was torn to pieces by the Clergy of Alexandria, to gratify the pride, emulation, and cruelty of their Archbishop, commonly, but undeservedly, stil'd St. Cyril.[53]

In turn, the Christians defended themselves from Toland with The History of Hypatia, a most Impudent School-Mistress of Alexandria: Murder'd and torn to Pieces by the Populace, in Defence of Saint Cyril and the Alexandrian Clergy from the Aspersions of Mr. Toland, by Thomas Lewis, in 1721.[54]
19th century
Hypatia, by Charles William Mitchell (1885), believed to be based on Charles Kingsley's 1853 novel where she is described as an erotic heroine.
Cameron's 1867 photograph Hypatia

In the 19th century, interest in the "literary legend of Hypatia" began to rise.[55] Diodata Saluzzo Roero's 1827 Ipazia ovvero delle Filosofie suggested that Cyril had actually converted Hypatia to Christianity, and that she had been killed by a "treacherous" priest.

In 1843, German authors Soldan and Heppe argued in their highly influential History of the Witchcraft Trials that Hypatia may have been, in effect, the first famous "witch" punished under Christian authority (see Witch-hunt).[56]

In his 1847 Hypatie and 1857 Hypatie et Cyrille, French poet Charles-Marie-René Leconte de Lisle portrayed Hypatia as the epitome of "vulnerable truth and beauty".[57]

Charles Kingsley's 1853 novel Hypatia – or New Foes with an Old Face, which portrayed the scholar as a "helpless, pretentious, and erotic heroine",[58] recounted her conversion by a Jewish-Christian named Raphael Aben-Ezra after supposedly becoming disillusioned with Orestes.

In 1867, the early photographer Julia Margaret Cameron created a portrait of the scholar as a young woman.[59] On 2 January 1893, a stage play "Hypatia", written by G. Stuart Ogilvie, opened at the Haymarket Theatre in London. It was based on the novel by Charles Kingsley, and was produced by Herbert Beerbohm Tree. The title role was initially played by Julia Neilson, and it featured an elaborate musical score written by the composer Hubert Parry.[60][61]
20th century
An actress, possibly Mary Anderson, in the title role of the play Hypatia, circa 1900.

Some authors mention her in passing, such as Marcel Proust, who dropped her name in the last sentence of "Madame Swann at Home", the first section of Within a Budding Grove.

Some characters are named after her, such as Hypatia Cade, a precocious child and main character in the science fiction novel The Ship Who Searched by Mercedes Lackey and Anne McCaffrey.

Rinne Groff's 2000 play The Five Hysterical Girls Theorem features a character named Hypatia who lives silently, in fear that she will suffer the fate of her namesake.

Hypatia is the name of a 'shipmind' (ship computer) in The Boy Who Would Live Forever, a novel in Frederik Pohl's Heechee series.

Umberto Eco's novel Baudolino sees the protagonist meet a secluded society of satyr-like creatures who all take their name and philosophy from Hypatia.

A fictional version of the historic character appears in several works and indeed series, such as

    The Heirs of Alexandria series written by Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint and Dave Freer, is an alternate history in which Hypatia was converted to Christianity by John Chrysostom, which saved her life and enabled her to stop the mob from destroying the Library of Alexandria, eventually resulting in her elevation to Sainthood. The books, taking place in the world of 1530 resulting from the above, include copies from the alternate Hypatia's influential correspondence with Chrysostom and St. Augustine, as well as a monastic order, the Hypatian Siblings.
    The Corto Maltese adventure Fable of Venice, by characteristic superposition of anachronistic elements, sees Hypatia preside over an intellectual salon in pre-Fascist Italy;
    As a recurring character in Mark London Williams's juvenile fiction Danger Boy.

She also appears, briefly, as one of the kidnapped scientists and philosophers in the Doctor Who serial Time and the Rani.

American astronomer Carl Sagan, in Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, gave a detailed speculative description of Hypatia's death, linking it with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria.

A more scholarly historical study of her, Hypatia of Alexandria by Maria Dzielska (translated into English by F. Lyra, published by Harvard University Press), was named by Choice Magazine as an "Outstanding Academic Book of 1995, Philosophy Category".

She has been claimed by second wave feminism, most prominently as Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy, published since 1986 by Indiana University Press.

Judy Chicago's large-scale The Dinner Party awards her a place-setting.[62]

A central character in Iain Pears's The Dream of Scipio is a woman philosopher clearly modeled on (though not identical with) Hypatia.[63]

The last two centuries have seen Hypatia's name honored in the sciences, especially astronomy. 238 Hypatia, a main belt asteroid discovered in 1884, was named for her. The lunar crater Hypatia was named for her, in addition to craters named for her father Theon and for Cyril. The 180 km Rimae Hypatia are located north of the crater, one degree south of the equator, along the Mare Tranquillitatis.[64]

By the end of the 20th, century Hypatia's name was applied to projects ranging in scope from an Adobe typeface (Hypatia Sans Pro),[65] to a cooperative community house in Madison, Wisconsin. A genus of moth also bears her name.
21st century

Her life continues to be fictionalized by authors in many countries and languages. Two recent examples are Ipazia, scienziata alessandrina by Adriano Petta (translated from the Italian in 2004 as Hypatia: Scientist of Alexandria), and Hypatia y la eternidad (Hypatia and Eternity) by Ramon Galí, a fanciful alternate history, in Spanish (2009).[66]

Azazil,[67] by Egyptian Muslim author Dr. Youssef Ziedan, tells the story of the religious conflict of that time through the eyes of a monk, including a substantial section on Hypatia;[68] Ziedan's[69] book has been criticized by Christians in Egypt.[70]

Her life is portrayed in the Malayalam novel Francis Itty Cora (2009) by T. D Ramakrishnan.

Examples in English include

    Remembering Hypatia: A Novel of Ancient Egypt by Brian Trent,;[71]
    Flow Down Like Silver, Hypatia of Alexandria (2009) by Ki Longfellow, the second in a trilogy of the divine feminine, the first being The Secret Magdalene;[72]
    The Plot to Save Socrates (2006) by Paul Levinson and his sequel Unburning Alexandria (novelette, 2008; novel 2013) – where Hypatia turns out to have been a time-traveler from 21st century America.[73][74][75]
    Heresy: the Life of Pelagius (2012) by David Lovejoy, which includes Hypatia's death as well as a portrait of Synesius[76]

More factually, Hypatia of Alexandria: Mathematician and Martyr (2007) is a brief (113 page) biography by Michael Deakin, with a focus on her mathematical research. Hypatia has been considered a universal genius.[77]

The 2009 movie Agora, directed by Alejandro Amenábar, focuses on Hypatia's final years. Hypatia, portrayed by actress Rachel Weisz, is seen investigating the heliocentric model of the solar system proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, and even anticipating the elliptical orbits discovered by Johannes Kepler 1200 years later.

The 2014 version of Cosmos portrays Hypatia in a similar vein as the 1980 version.

Dzielska 1995, pp. 71–2; "Until recently scholars thought that Hypatia revised Theon's commentary on Almagest.

Cameron, who analyzed Theon's titles for other books of Almagest and for other scholarly texts of late antiquity, concludes that Hypatia corrected not her father's commentary but the text of Almagest itself. Thus, the extant text of Almagest could have been prepared, at least partly, by Hypatia".

'The invention of the astrolabe is usually attributed to Hipparchus of the second century BC. But there is no firm evidence to support this view. It is however certain that the instrument was well known to the Greeks before the beginning of the Christian era.', Sarma, 'The Archaic and the Exotic: studies in the history of Indian astronomical instruments', p. 241 (2008).

William Shakespeare (/ˈʃeɪkspɪər/;[1] 26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616)[nb 1] was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[2] He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon".[3][nb 2] His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays,[nb 3] 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, of which the authorship of some is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[4]

Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[5]

Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.[6][nb 4] His early plays were mainly comedies and histories and these works remain regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.

Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as "not of an age, but for all time".[7] In the 20th and 21st century, his work has been repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.

Main article: Shakespeare's life
Early life

William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.[8] He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day.[9] This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers, since Shakespeare died 23 April 1616.[10] He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.[11]

Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford,[12] a free school chartered in 1553,[13] about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar, the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree,[14] and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.[15]

At the age of 18, Shakespeare married the 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.[16] The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste, since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times,[17] and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583.[18] Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585.[19] Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.[20]

After the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the 'complaints bill' of a law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589.[21] Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's "lost years".[22] Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him.[23] Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London.[24] John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster.[25] Some 20th-century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain "William Shakeshafte" in his will.[26] Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area.[27]
London and theatrical career

"All the world's a stage,
and all the men and women merely players:
they have their exits and their entrances;
and one man in his time plays many parts..."
—As You Like It, Act II, Scene 7, 139–42[28]

It is not known exactly when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.[29] By then, he was sufficiently well known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit:

    ...there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.[30]

Scholars differ on the exact meaning of these words,[31] but most agree that Greene is accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match university-educated writers such as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe and Greene himself (the "university wits").[32] The italicised phrase parodying the line "Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide" from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3, along with the pun "Shake-scene", identifies Shakespeare as Greene's target. Here Johannes Factotum—"Jack of all trades"— means a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common "universal genius".[31][33]

Greene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's career in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks.[34] From 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed by only the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London.[35] After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new king, James I, and changed its name to the King's Men.[36]

In 1599, a partnership of company members built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they called the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that the company made him a wealthy man.[37] In 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, he invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.[38]

Some of Shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions from 1594. By 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages.[39] Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603).[40] The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.[41] The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of "the Principal Actors in all these Plays", some of which were first staged after Volpone, although we cannot know for certain which roles he played.[42] In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that "good Will" played "kingly" roles.[43] In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father.[44] Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It and the Chorus in Henry V,[45] though scholars doubt the sources of the information.[46]

Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford during his career. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames.[47][48] He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.[47][49] By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of ladies' wigs and other headgear.[50]
Later years and death

Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford 'some years before his death'.[51][52] He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men 'placed men players' there, 'which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.'.[53] However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609.[54][55] The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610),[56] which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.[57] Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614.[51] In 1612, he was called as a witness in Bellott v. Mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary.[58] In March 1613 he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory;[59] and from November 1614 he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall.[60] After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.[61] His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher,[62] who succeeded him as the house playwright for the King's Men.[63]
Shakespeare's funerary monument in Stratford-upon-Avon.

Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52.[64] He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in "perfect health". There is no extant contemporary source that explains how or why he died. After half a century had passed, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: "Shakespeare, Drayton and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted."[65][66] This is not impossible, for Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes that started to come from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively early death: "We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon/From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room."[67]

He was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607,[68] and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death.[69] Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.[70]

In his will, Shakespeare left the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna.[71] The terms instructed that she pass it down intact to "the first son of her body".[72] The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying.[73] The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line.[74] Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one third of his estate automatically.[75] He did make a point, however, of leaving her "my second best bed", a bequest that has led to much speculation.[76] Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.[77]

Shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death.[78] The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008:[79]

(Modern spelling: Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, | To dig the dust enclosed here. | Blessed be the man that spares these stones, | And cursed be he that moves my bones.)

Sometime before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor, Socrates, and Virgil.[81] In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio, the Droeshout engraving was published.[82]

Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.

Main articles: Shakespeare's plays and William Shakespeare's collaborations

Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career.[83] Some attributions, such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays, remain controversial, while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well-attested contemporary documentation. Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised by other writers after their original composition.

The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date, however,[84] and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period.[85] His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland,[86] dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty.[87] The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca.[88] The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story.[89] Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape,[90] the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors.[91]

Shakespeare's early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies.[92] A Midsummer Night's Dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.[93] Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic Merchant of Venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences.[94] The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing,[95] the charming rural setting of As You Like It, and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare's sequence of great comedies.[96] After the lyrical Richard II, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and Henry V. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.[97] This period begins and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death;[98] and Julius Caesar—based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's Parallel Lives—which introduced a new kind of drama.[99] According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in Julius Caesar "the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other".[100]

In the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called "problem plays" Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and All's Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies.[101] Many critics believe that Shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art. The titular hero of one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies, Hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins "To be or not to be; that is the question".[102] Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, Othello and King Lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement.[103] The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.[104] In Othello, the villain Iago stokes Othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him.[105] In King Lear, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, "the play-offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty".[106] In Macbeth, the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare's tragedies,[107] uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne, until their own guilt destroys them in turn.[108] In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus, contain some of Shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot.[109]

In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, as well as the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.[110] Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day.[111] Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher.[112]
Performances
Main article: Shakespeare in performance

It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.[113] After the plagues of 1592–3, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames.[114] Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV, Leonard Digges recording, "Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest...and you scarce shall have a room".[115] When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark.[116] The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with Julius Caesar one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including Hamlet, Othello and King Lear.[117]
The reconstructed Globe Theatre, London.

After the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy, the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605, including two performances of The Merchant of Venice.[118] After 1608, they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer.[119] The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In Cymbeline, for example, Jupiter descends "in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees."[120]

The actors in Shakespeare's company included the famous Richard Burbage, William Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including Richard III, Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear.[121] The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing, among other characters.[122] He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear.[123] In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII "was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony".[124] On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision.[124]
Textual sources

In 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays. It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time.[125] Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.[126] No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as "stol'n and surreptitious copies".[127] Alfred Pollard termed some of them "bad quartos" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.[128] Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers.[129] In some cases, for example Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida and Othello, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto, that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.[130]
Poems

In 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on erotic themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin.[131] Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses,[132] the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.[133] Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.[134] The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.[135]
Sonnets
Main article: Shakespeare's sonnets
Title page from 1609 edition of Shake-Speares Sonnets.

Published in 1609, the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership.[136] Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's "sugred Sonnets among his private friends".[137] Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence.[138] He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the "dark lady"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the "fair youth"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial "I" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets "Shakespeare unlocked his heart".[139]

"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate..."
—Lines from Shakespeare's Sonnet 18.[140]

The 1609 edition was dedicated to a "Mr. W.H.", credited as "the only begetter" of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication.[141] Critics praise the Sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.[142]
Style
Main article: Shakespeare's style

Shakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.[143] The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.[144]

Soon, however, Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.[145] No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.[146] By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.
Pity by William Blake, 1795, Tate Britain, is an illustration of two similes in Macbeth:
"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd
Upon the sightless couriers of the air."[147]

Shakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.[148] Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:[149]

    Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—
    And prais'd be rashness for it—let us know
    Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well...

    Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 2, 4–8[149]

After Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as "more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical".[150] In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.[151] In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: "was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?" (1.7.35–38); "...pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air..." (1.7.21–25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense.[151] The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.[152]

Shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.[153] Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed.[154] He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.[155] As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.[156]
Influence

Shakespeare's work has made a lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre.[157] Until Romeo and Juliet, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy.[158] Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events; but Shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds.[159] His work heavily influenced later poetry. The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success. Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as "feeble variations on Shakespearean themes."[160]

Shakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is a classic tragic hero, inspired by King Lear.[161] Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays.[162] Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German.[163] The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.[164]

In Shakespeare's day, English grammar, spelling and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now,[165] and his use of language helped shape modern English.[166] Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his A Dictionary of the English Language, the first serious work of its type.[167] Expressions such as "with bated breath" (Merchant of Venice) and "a foregone conclusion" (Othello) have found their way into everyday English speech.[168]
Critical reputation
Main articles: Shakespeare's reputation and Timeline of Shakespeare criticism

"He was not of an age, but for all time."
—Ben Jonson[169]

Shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise.[170] In 1598, the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English writers as "the most excellent" in both comedy and tragedy.[171] The authors of the Parnassus plays at St John's College, Cambridge numbered him with Chaucer, Gower and Spenser.[172] In the First Folio, Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the "Soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage", though he had remarked elsewhere that "Shakespeare wanted art".

Between the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson.[173] Thomas Rymer, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, "I admire him, but I love Shakespeare".[174] For several decades, Rymer's view held sway; but during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation.[175] By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet.[176] In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal and Victor Hugo.[177]

During the Romantic era, Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge; and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism.[178] In the 19th century, critical admiration for Shakespeare's genius often bordered on adulation.[179] "That King Shakespeare," the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840, "does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible".[180] The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale.[181] The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as "bardolatry", claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsen's plays had made Shakespeare obsolete.[182]

The modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde. The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T.S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare's "primitiveness" in fact made him truly modern.[183] Eliot, along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare's imagery. In the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for "post-modern" studies of Shakespeare.[184] By the 1980s, Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism, feminism, New Historicism, African-American studies, and queer studies.[185][186] In a comprehensive reading of Shakespeare's works and comparing Shakespeare literary accomplishments to accomplishments among leading figures in philosophy and theology as well, Harold Bloom has commented that, "Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He encloses us, because we see with his fundamental perceptions."[187]
Speculation about Shakespeare
Authorship
Main article: Shakespeare authorship question

Around 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him.[188] Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.[189] Several "group theories" have also been proposed.[190] Only a small minority of academics believe there is reason to question the traditional attribution,[191] but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century.[192]
Religion
Main article: Shakespeare's religion

Some scholars claim that members of Shakespeare's family were Catholics, at a time when Catholic practice was against the law.[193] Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. The document is now lost, however, and scholars differ as to its authenticity.[194] In 1591 the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church "for fear of process for debt", a common Catholic excuse.[195] In 1606 the name of William's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford.[195] As several scholars have noted, whatever his private views, Shakespeare "conformed to the official state religion", as Park Honan put it.[196][197] Shakespeare's will uses a Protestant formula and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he got married, his children were baptized, and where he was buried. Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare's religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.[198]
Sexuality
Main article: Sexuality of William Shakespeare

Few details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known. At 18, he married the 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,[199] and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than sexual love.[200] The 26 so-called "Dark Lady" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.[201]
Portraiture
Main article: Portraits of Shakespeare

No written contemporary description of Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness,[202] and his Stratford monument provide the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as mis-attributions, repaintings and relabelling of portraits of other people.[203]

Classification of the plays
The Plays of William Shakespeare. By Sir John Gilbert, 1849.

Shakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories and tragedies.[204] Two plays not included in the First Folio, The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles, Prince of Tyre, are now accepted as part of the canon, with scholars agreed that Shakespeare made a major contribution to their composition.[205] No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio.

In the late 19th century, Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies, his term is often used.[206] These plays and the associated Two Noble Kinsmen are marked with an asterisk (*) below. In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term "problem plays" to describe four plays: All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida and Hamlet.[207] "Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies", he wrote. "We may therefore borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare's problem plays."[208] The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy.[209]

Notes
Footnotes

Dates follow the Julian calendar, used in England throughout Shakespeare's lifespan, but with the start of year adjusted to 1 January (see Old Style and New Style dates). Under the Gregorian calendar, adopted in Catholic countries in 1582, Shakespeare died on 3 May (Schoenbaum 1987, xv).
The "national cult" of Shakespeare, and the "bard" identification, dates from September 1769, when the actor David Garrick organised a week-long carnival at Stratford to mark the town council awarding him the freedom of the town. In addition to presenting the town with a statue of Shakespeare, Garrick composed a doggerel verse, lampooned in the London newspapers, naming the banks of the Avon as the birthplace of the "matchless Bard" (McIntyre 1999, 412–432).

N-Gram-Based Text Categorization
William B. Cavnar and John M. Trenkle
Environmental Research Institute of Michigan
P.O. Box 134001
Ann Arbor MI 48113-4001
Abstract
Text categorization is a fundamental task in document
processing, allowing the automated handling
of enormous streams of documents in
electronic form. One difficulty in handling some
classes of documents is the presence of different
kinds of textual errors, such as spelling and
grammatical errors in email, and character recognition
errors in documents that come through
OCR. Text categorization must work reliably on
all input, and thus must tolerate some level of
these kinds of problems.
We describe here an N-gram-based approach
to text categorization that is tolerant of textual
errors. The system is small, fast and robust. This
system worked very well for language classification,
achieving in one test a 99.8% correct classification
rate on Usenet newsgroup articles
written in different languages. The system also
worked reasonably well for classifying articles
from a number of different computer-oriented
newsgroups according to subject, achieving as
high as an 80% correct classification rate. There
are also several obvious directions for improving
the system’s classification performance in those
cases where it did not do as well.
The system is based on calculating and comparing
profiles of N-gram frequencies. First, we
use the system to compute profiles on training set
data that represent the various categories, e.g.,
language samples or newsgroup content samples.
Then the system computes a profile for a
particular document that is to be classified.
Finally, the system computes a distance measure
between the document’s profile and each of the
category profiles. The system selects the category
whose profile has the smallest distance to the
document’s profile. The profiles involved are
quite small, typically 10K bytes for a category
training set, and less than 4K bytes for an individual
document.
Using N-gram frequency profiles provides a
simple and reliable way to categorize documents
in a wide range of classification tasks.
1.0 Introduction
Electronic documents come from a wide variety
of sources. Many are generated with various
word processing software packages, and are subjected
to various kinds of automatic scrutiny,
e.g., spelling checkers, as well as to manual editing
and revision. Many other documents, however,
do not have the benefit of this kind of
scrutiny, and thus may contain significant numbers
of errors of various kinds. Email messages
and bulletin board postings, for example, are
often composed on the fly and sent without even
the most cursory levels of inspection and correction.
Also, paper documents that are digitally
scanned and run through an OCR system will
doubtless contain at least some recognition
errors. It is precisely on these kinds of documents,
where further manual inspection and correction
is difficult and costly, that there would be
the greatest benefit in automatic processing.
One fundamental kind of document processing
is text categorization, in which an incoming
document is assigned to some pre-existing category.
Routing news articles from a newswire is
one application for such a system. Sorting
through digitized paper archives would be
another. These applications have the following
characteristics:
• The categorization must work reliably in
spite of textual errors.
• The categorization must be efficient, consuming
as little storage and processing
time as possible, because of the sheer volume
of documents to be handled.
• The categorization must be able to recognize
when a given document does not
match any category, or when it falls
between two categories. This is because
category boundaries are almost never clearcut.
In this paper we will cover the following topics:
• Section 2.0 introduces N-grams and Ngram-
based similarity measures.
• Section 3.0 discusses text categorization
using N-gram frequency statistics.
• Section 4.0 discusses testing N-grambased
text categorization on a language
classification task.
• Section 5.0 discusses testing N-grambased
text categorization on a computer
newsgroup classification task.
• Section 6.0 discusses some advantages of
N-gram-based text categorization over
other possible approaches.
• Section 7.0 gives some conclusions, and
indicates directions for further work.
2.0 N-Grams
An N-gram is an N-character slice of a longer
string. Although in the literature the term can
include the notion of any co-occurring set of
characters in a string (e.g., an N-gram made up
of the first and third character of a word), in this
paper we use the term for contiguous slices only.
Typically, one slices the string into a set of overlapping
N-grams. In our system, we use N-grams
of several different lengths simultaneously. We
also append blanks to the beginning and ending
of the string in order to help with matching
beginning-of-word and ending-of-word situations.
(We will use the underscore character (“_”)
to represent blanks.) Thus, the word “TEXT”
would be composed of the following N-grams:
bi-grams: _T, TE, EX, XT, T_
tri-grams: _TE, TEX, EXT, XT_, T_ _
quad-grams: _TEX, TEXT, EXT_, XT_ _, T_ _ _
In general, a string of length k, padded with
blanks, will have k+1 bi-grams, k+1tri-grams,
k+1 quad-grams, and so on.
N-gram-based matching has had some success
in dealing with noisy ASCII input in other
problem domains, such as in interpreting postal
addresses ([1] and [2]), in text retrieval ([3] and
[4]), and in a wide variety of other natural language
processing applications[5]. The key benefit
that N-gram-based matching provides derives
from its very nature: since every string is decomposed
into small parts, any errors that are present
tend to affect only a limited number of those
parts, leaving the remainder intact. If we count
N-grams that are common to two strings, we get
a measure of their similarity that is resistant to a
wide variety of textual errors.
3.0 Text Categorization Using NGram
Frequency Statistics
Human languages invariably have some words
which occur more frequently than others. One of
the most common ways of expressing this idea
has become known as Zipf’s Law [6], which we
can re-state as follows:
The nth most common word in a human language
text occurs with a frequency inversely proportional
to n.
The implication of this law is that there is
always a set of words which dominates most of
the other words of the language in terms of frequency
of use. This is true both of words in general,
and of words that are specific to a particular
subject. Furthermore, there is a smooth continuum
of dominance from most frequent to least.
The smooth nature of the frequency curves helps
us in some ways, because it implies that we do
not have to worry too much about specific frequency
thresholds. This same law holds, at least
approximately, for other aspects of human languages.
In particular, it is true for the frequency
of occurrence of N-grams, both as inflection
forms and as morpheme-like word components
which carry meaning. (See Figure 1 for an example
of a Zipfian distribution of N-gram frequencies
from a technical document.) Zipf’s Law
implies that classifying documents with N-gram
frequency statistics will not be very sensitive to
cutting off the distributions at a particular rank. It
also implies that if we are comparing documents
from the same category they should have similar
N-gram frequency distributions.
We have built an experimental text categorization
system that uses this idea. Figure 2 illustrates
the overall data flow for the system. In this
scheme, we start with a set of pre-existing text
categories (such as subject domains) for which
we have reasonably sized samples, say, of 10K to
20K bytes each. From these, we would generate
a set of N-gram frequency profiles to represent
each of the categories. When a new document
arrives for classification, the system first computes
its N-gram frequency profile. It then compares
this profile against the profiles for each of
the categories using an easily calculated distance
measure. The system classifies the document as
belonging to the category having the smallest
distance.
3.1 Generating N-Gram Frequency
Profiles
The bubble in Figure 2 labelled “Generate
Profile” is very simple. It merely reads incoming
text, and counts the occurrences of all N-grams.
To do this, the system performs the following
steps:
• Split the text into separate tokens consisting
only of letters and apostrophes. Digits
and punctuation are discarded. Pad the
token with sufficient blanks before and
after.
• Scan down each token, generating all possible
N-grams, for N=1 to 5. Use positions
that span the padding blanks, as well.
• Hash into a table to find the counter for the
N-gram, and increment it. The hash table
uses a conventional collision handling
mechanism to ensure that each N-gram
gets its own counter.
• When done, output all N-grams and their
counts.
• Sort those counts into reverse order by the
number of occurrences. Keep just the Ngrams
themselves, which are now in
reverse order of frequency.

N-Gram Frequency

N-Gram Rank
The resulting file is then an N-gram frequency
profile for the document. When we plot
the frequencies in this profile by rank, we get a
Zipfian distribution graph very similar to that in
Figure 2. We can make the following informal
observations from an inspection of a number of
different N-gram frequency profiles for a variety
of different category samples:
• The top 300 or so N-grams are almost
always highly correlated to the language.
That is, a long English passage about compilers
and a long English passage about
poetry would tend to have a great many Ngrams
in common in the top 300 entries of
their respective profiles. On the other hand,
a long passage in French on almost any
topic would have a very different distribution
of the first 300 N-grams.
• The very highest ranking N-grams are
mostly uni-grams (N=1), and simply reflect
the distribution of the letters of the alphabet
in the document’s language. After that
come N-grams that comprise function
words (such as determiners) and very frequent
prefixes and suffixes. There is, of
course, a long tail to the distribution of language-
specific N-grams, and it goes well
past 300.
• Starting around rank 300 or so, an N-gram
frequency profile begins to show N-grams
that are more specific to the subject of the

document. These represent terms and
stems that occur very frequently in documents
about the subject.
• There is nothing special about rank 300
itself, since Zipf’s law gives us in fact a
very smooth distribution curve. Rather, we
arrived at this number mostly by inspection.
Doubtless, one could do more elaborate
statistics and choose an optimal cutoff
rank for a particular application.
We should note that these observations apply
mostly to shorter documents, such as those from
newsgroups. If documents were longer, the shift
from language-specific N-grams to subject-specific
N-grams would like occur at a later rank.
3.2 Comparing and Ranking N-Gram
Frequency Profiles
The bubble in Figure 2 labelled “Measure
Profile Distance” is also very simple. It merely
takes two N-gram profiles and calculates a simple
rank-order statistic we call the “out-of-place”
measure. This measure determines how far out of
place an N-gram in one profile is from its place
in the other profile. Figure 3 gives a simple
example of this calculation using a few N-grams.
For each N-gram in the document profile, we
find its counterpart in the category profile, and
then calculate how far out of place it is. For
example, in Figure 3, the N-gram “ING” is at
rank 2 in the document, but at rank 5 in the category.
Thus it is 3 ranks out of place. If an N-gram
(such as “ED” in the figure) is not in the category
profile, it takes some maximum out-of-place
value. The sum of all of the out-of-place values
for all N-grams is the distance measure for the
document from the category. We could also use
other kinds of statistical measures for ranked lists
(such as the Wilcoxin rank sum test). However,
the out-of-place score provides a simple and
intuitive distance measure that seems to work
well enough for these proof-of-concept tests.
Finally, the bubble labelled “Find Minimum
Distance” simply takes the distance measures
from all of the category profiles to the document
profile, and picks the smallest one.
4.0 Testing N-Gram-Based Text
Categorization on Language
Classification
Most writing systems support more than one language.
For example, nearly all of the languages
from the former Soviet Union use the Cyrillic
script. Given a text that uses a particular writing
system, it is necessary to determine the language
in which it is written before further processing is
possible.
There are several broad approaches to the
language classification problem. One obvious
technique is to keep a lexicon for each possible
language, and then to look up every word in the
sample text to see in which lexicon it falls. The
lexicon that contains the most words from the
sample indicates which language was used.
However, building or obtaining representative
lexicons is not necessarily easy, especially
for some of the lesser-used languages. Furthermore,
if the language is highly inflected, that is,
using many different forms for each word to indicate
case, tense or other attributes, then either the
lexicons must become several times larger to get
the necessary word inclusion, or one must
develop some language-specific morphological
processing to reduce different forms to their
stems. Finally, if the text is the result of an OCR
process, there may be recognition errors due to
poor image quality, and these will disrupt the lexicon
lookup process.
Another approach to language classification
involves the use of N-gram analysis. The basic
idea is to identify N-grams whose occurrence in
a document gives strong evidence for or against
identification of a text as belonging to a particular
language. Although this has been done before,
it makes a good test case for our text categorization
method. We can use the N-gram frequency
profile technique to classify documents according
to their language without building a lexicon
or a set of morphological processing rules.
Instead, we need merely obtain modestly sized
sample texts (10K to 20K bytes), calculate the Ngram
frequency profiles, and use those to classify
the documents.
4.1 Language Classification Testing
Procedure
In this test, our N-gram-based text categorization
system very reliably identified the language
of electronic mail messages taken from
some of the Usenet newsgroups. These messages
came in a variety of languages, but were all presented
in standard ASCII, with a few typographical
conventions to handle such things as
diacritical markings. The classification procedure
was as follows:
• Obtained training sets (category samples)
for each language to be classified. Typically,
these training sets were on the order
of 20K to 120K bytes in length. There was
no particular format requirement, but each
training set did not contain samples of any
language other than the one it was supposed
to represent.
• Computed N-gram frequency profiles on
the training sets as described above.
• Computed each article’s N-gram profile as
described above. The resulting profile was
on the order of 4K in length.
• Computed an overall distance measure
between the sample’s profile and the category
profile for each language using the
out-of-place measure, and then picked the
category with the smallest distance.
Such a system has modest computational and
storage requirements, and is very effective. It
requires no semantic or content analysis apart
from the N-gram frequency profile itself.
4.2 Language Classification Test Data
For this test, we collected 3713 language
samples from the soc.culture newsgroup hierarchy
of the Usenet. These newsgroups are devoted
to discussions about topics relevant to particular
countries or cultures. Generally, those discussions
were in the language of the particular country/
culture, although some articles were partly or
wholly in English. Table 1 gives a breakdown of
the number of samples for each group, the supposed
principal language for the group, the number
of non-English articles, the number of
English articles, the number of mixed language
articles, the number of articles that contain junk
(i.e., not a body of recognizable text), and the
number of usable articles (pure English or pure
non-English) for the test.
The sample articles ranged in size from a single
line of text to as much as 50K bytes, with the

average around 1700 bytes. The sample extraction
program also removed the usual header
information, such as subject and keyword identification,
leaving only the body of the article. This
prevented any matches that were too strongly
influenced by standard header information for
the newsgroup (e.g., the newsgroup name or
other lengthy identification phrases). For each
language, we also assembled from manually
selected and edited newsgroup articles an independent
training set of 20K to 120K bytes in
length. The N-gram frequency files for these
training sets become the language profiles used
by the classification procedure.
We determined the true classification for each
test sample semi-automatically. First, we
assumed that each sample was in fact in the language
corresponding to the dominant language
for the newsgroup it came from. For example, we
would expect that a sample from the france
newsgroup would be in French. This produced a
default classification for each sample. Then we
classified the sample with the procedure outlined
earlier. We compared the resulting classification
to the default one. If there was a discrepancy, that
is, if the classification procedure identified the
sample as being from some language other than
the default, we then manually inspected the sample
and gave it a corrected classification, if necessary.
We also determined by this process
articles which had mixed languages (e.g., interspersed
passages in English and Portuguese) or
junk (no recognizable body of text) and removed
them from the test set. The resulting test set consisted
of 3478 usable articles consisting of reasonably
pure samples of a single language.
4.3 Language Classification Results
We have categorized the results along several
dimensions. First, we kept track of whether the
original article was over or under 300 bytes in
length. Our initial hypothesis was that the system
would have more problems classifying shorter
messages because there would be a smaller
amount of text from which to compute N-gram
frequencies. On the whole, the system was only
slightly sensitive to length. Second, we also varied
the number of the N-gram frequencies available
in the profile for the match, by limiting it to

statistics for 100, 200, 300 or 400 N-grams. This
variable did have an impact on match performance,
although by the 400 N-gram level language
classification was almost perfect. Table 2
gives the classification percent correct for each
combination of test variables, while Table 3 gives
the ratio of errors committed to samples processed.
These results show some interesting patterns:
• The classification procedure works a little
better for longer articles, but not quite as
much as we expected.
• For the most part, the classification procedure
works better the longer the category
profile it has to use for matching. However,
there were some interesting anomalies,
indicated by the cells with asterisks on
Table 2. These represent combinations of
test variables that did worse than similar
combinations with shorter profiles. In other
words, for these cases, using more N-gram
frequencies actually decreased classification
performance. Post mortem examination
of the problematic articles showed that
at least part of the difficulty was that, in
spite of the manual truthing efforts to
remove mixed text, some articles still had
passages from two languages. The interfering
passages were mostly in the so-called
signature blocks which are customary at
the end of Usenet articles. In mixed language
situations, this system, which used a
forced choice selection, had no good mechanism
for dealing with two language profiles
with very similar distance measures
from the article. In this case, adding statistics
for more N-grams may then push one
distance measure slightly ahead of the
other in a hard-to-predict fashion.
Overall, the system yielded its best performance
at a profile length of 400 N-grams. At this

5.0 Testing N-Gram-Based Text
Categorization on Subject
Classification
The same text categorization approach easily
extends to the notion of using N-gram frequency
to measure subject similarity for documents that
are in the same language. Indeed, the approach
extends to a multi-language database where both
the language and the content of the document are
of interest in the retrieval process. In order to test
this approach, we used this classification system
to identify the appropriate newsgroup for newsgroup
articles. The articles for this experiment
came from some of the Usenet newsgroups. We
wished to see how accurately the system would
identify which newsgroup each message originally
came from. The classification procedure
was as follows:
• Obtained training sets for each newsgroup.
For this purpose, we used articles known as
frequently-asked-question (FAQ) lists.
Many newsgroups regularly publish such
FAQs as a way of reducing traffic in the
group by answering questions or discussing
issues that come up a lot in the group.
In this sense, then, the FAQ for a newsgroup
tries to define what the newsgroup is
(and is not) about, and as such contains
much of the core terminology for the
group. The FAQs we have collected are
between 18K and 132K in length. There is
no particular format requirement, but the
FAQ should provide adequate coverage for
the subject matter of the newsgroup.
• Computed N-gram frequencies on the
newsgroup’s FAQ. These are exactly the
same as the other kinds of N-gram fre-

quency profiles mentioned earlier. The
resulting profiles are quite small, on the
order of 10K bytes or less.
• Computed an article’s N-gram profile in a
fashion similar to that for computing the
profile for each FAQ. The articles averaged
2K in length and the resulting article profiles
were on the order of 4K in length.
• Computed an overall distance measure
between the article’s profile and the profile
for each newsgroup’s FAQ. The FAQ profile
with the smallest distance measure
from the article’s profile determined which
newsgroup to classify the sample as.
• Compared the selected newsgroup from
the actual one the article came from.
5.1 Subject Classification Test Data
To test this system, we collected article samples
from five Usenet newsgroups. These newsgroups
are shown in Table 4. We chose these five
because they were all subfields of computer science,
and thus would provide an opportunity for
testing how the system might confuse newsgroups
that were somewhat closely related. The
article extraction program also removed the usual
header information such as subject and keyword
identification, leaving only the body of the article.
This prevented any matches that were too
strongly influenced by standard header information
for the newsgroup (e.g., the newsgroup
name). For the profiles, we chose the FAQs
shown in Table 5. Notice that there is some, but
not perfect, overlap with the selected newsgroups
for the experiment:
• There are FAQs for rec.games.go and
comp.robotics, but no articles from either
group.
• There are two FAQs related to compression,
covering slightly different areas.
• There are articles for comp.graphics, but
no FAQ.
Given this setup, we ran the classification
procedure outlined above for all 778 newsgroup
articles against the 7 selected FAQs. Our results
are shown in Table 6. In the table, we can see the
following strong results:
• The security FAQ provides 77% coverage
of alt.security.
• The compilers FAQ provides 80% coverage
of comp.compilers.
• The compression and jpeg_compression
FAQs together provide 78% coverage of
comp.compression.
• The go FAQ picked up only 3 articles altogether,
indicating that its coverage is
almost completely disjoint from the five
selected newsgroups.
There are also these somewhat weaker
results:
• The robotics FAQ picked up 11 ai articles
and 23 graphics articles. This is probably
because of the relative proximity of these
subfields to robotics.
• The ai FAQ provides only 30% coverage of
the comp.ai group. Noticing that the ai
FAQ is nearly twice as large as the next
largest FAQ, we can speculate that it may
in fact cover too much material, thus
throwing off the statistical nature of the Ngram
frequency measure. This may also
reflect the fact that comp.ai really consists
of several related but distinct subgroups
(expert systems, connectionism/neural networks,
vision systems, theorem provers,
etc.) that happen to share the same newsgroup.
• The articles from comp.graphics were distributed
among the other FAQs. This is not
unexpected since we did not include the
FAQ from comp.graphics for the articles to
match to. It is interesting that the strongest
matching FAQ for these articles was
jpeg_compression, which covers a compression
standard for graphical data, and
thus was a strong plausible contender for
the match. It earned a 44% coverage of
comp.graphics.
Overall, the system works quite well given
the somewhat noisy nature of the newsgroups,
and the necessarily incomplete nature of the FAQ
lists. Although we do not analyze it here, cursory
manual examination of the results showed that
when the system matched an article against the
incorrect FAQ, the correct FAQ was generally the
second choice. Another thing to keep in mind is
that we did not determine the actual contents of
each article to see if it rightly belonged to the
group it appeared in. In Usenet newsgroups, spurious
cross-posting of irrelevant articles (e.g.,

and some of those are present in our samples.
Also, it is entirely possible for articles to be truly
interdisciplinary, e.g., an article on using
advanced AI techniques for detecting hacker
intrusion patterns could appear in alt.security.
Such an article might match strongly to two
groups simultaneously.
6.0 Advantages of the N-Gram
Frequency Technique
The primary advantage of this approach is that it
is ideally suited for text coming from noisy
sources such as email or OCR systems. We originally
developed N-gram-based approaches to
various document processing operations to use
with very low-quality images such as those
found in postal addresses. Although one might
hope that scanned documents that find their way
into text collections suitable for retrieval will be
of somewhat higher quality, we expect that there
will be a large amount of variability in the document
database. This variability is be due to such
factors as scanner differences, original document
printing quality, low quality photocopies, and
faxes, as well as preprocessing and character recognition
differences. Our N-gram-based scheme
provides robust access in the face of such errors.
This capability may make it acceptable to use a
very fast but low quality character recognition
module for similarity analysis.
It is possible that one could achieve similar
results using whole word statistics. In this
approach, one would use the frequency statistics
for whole words. However, there are several possible
problems with this idea. One is that the system
becomes much more sensitive to OCR
problems—a single misrecognized character
throws off the statistics for a whole word. A second
possible difficulty is that short passages
(such as Usenet articles) are simply too short to
get representative subject word statistics. By definition,
there are simply more N-grams in a given
passage than there are words, and there are consequently
greater opportunities to collect enough
N-grams to be significant for matching. We hope
to directly compare the performance of N-grambased
profiling with whole-word-based profiling
in the near future.
Another related idea is that by using N-gram
analysis, we get word stemming essentially for
free. The N-grams for related forms of a word
(e.g., ‘advance’, ‘advanced’, ‘advancing’,
‘advancement’, etc.) automatically have a lot in
common when viewed as sets of N-grams. To get
equivalent results with whole words, the system
would have to perform word stemming, which
would require that the system have detailed
knowledge about the particular language that the
documents were written in. The N-gram frequency
approach provides language independence
for free.
Other advantages of this approach are the
ability to work equally well with short and long
documents, and the minimal storage and computational
requirements.
7.0 Conclusions And Future
Directions
The N-gram frequency method provides an inexpensive
and highly effective way of classifying
documents. It does so by using samples of the
desired categories rather than resorting to more
complicated and costly methods such as natural
language parsing or assembling detailed lexicons.
Essentially this approach defines a “categorization
by example” method. Collecting samples
and building profiles can even be handled in a
largely automatic way. Also, this system is resistant
to various OCR problems, since it depends
on the statistical properties of N-gram occurrences
and not on any particular occurrence of a
word.
Although the existing system already has
demonstrated good performance, there is considerable
room for further work:
• Currently the system uses a number of different
N-grams, some of which ultimately
are more dependent on the language of the
document than the words comprising its
content. By omitting the statistics for those
N-grams which are extremely common
because they are essentially features of the
language, it may be possible to get better
discrimination from those statistics that
remain. It is also possible that the system
should include some additional statistics
for rarer N-grams, thus gaining further
coverage.
• It seems clear that the quality of the document
set affects the subject categorization
performance. We would like to experiment
with document sets that have a higher overall
coherence and quality. For example, it
would be interesting to test this technique
on a set of technical abstracts for several
different areas. By splitting the set for each
area into training and testing portions, then
computing the profile for each area from
the training set, we could repeat this experiment
in a more controlled way.
• In a related issue, the quality of the training
set in general greatly affects matching
performance. Although the FAQs were
easy to obtain and work with, other training
sets might have produced better results,
even for these newsgroups. Of necessity, a
FAQ lags the group it covers, since new
“hot” topics of discussion have not yet
made it into the FAQ. To test this, it would
be interesting to compare the FAQ-based
profiles with profiles derived from a separate
set of articles from the appropriate
newsgroups.
• The raw match scores the system produces
are largely useless by themselves except
for imposing an overall relative ordering of
matches for the various profiles. To correct
this, we must devise a good normalization
scheme, which would produce some sort of
absolute measure of how good a particular
match really is. This would allow the system
to reject some documents on the
grounds that their normalized scores were
so low that the documents did not have
good matches at all. Normalized scores
would also let the system determine if a
particular document lay between two classifications
because of its interdisciplinary
nature. A related idea would be to see how
well the system could predict which articles
get cross-posted to different groups
precisely because of their interdisciplinary
content.
• This type of document similarity measure
is ideally suited for document filtering and
routing. All that a user needs to do is collect
a representative set of documents that
cover the relevant topics, then compute an
overall profile. From that point on, it is
simple and cheap to compute the profile of
every incoming document, match it against
the user’s overall profile, and accept those
whose match scores are sufficiently good.
• This system currently handles only languages
that are directly representable in
ASCII. The emerging ISO-6048/UNICODE
standard opens up the possibility of
applying the N-gram frequency idea to all
of the languages of the world, including the
ideographic ones.

'''World War II''' was the most extensive and costly [[war|armed conflict]] in the [[history of the world]], involving the great majority of the world's [[nation]]s, being fought simultaneously in several major theatres, and costing tens of millions of lives.
The German [[Polish September Campaign|invasion of Poland]] on [[September 1]] [[1939]] is the most common date in the West for the start of World War II. Others cite the Japanese invasion of China on [[July 7]], [[1937]], as the war's beginning, or even the [[1931]] Japanese incursion into [[Manchuria]]. The war ended in Europe with the surrender of Germany on [[May 8]], [[1945]], but continued in Asia and the Pacific until the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear bombing]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] and the subsequent [[V-J Day|Japanese surrender]] on [[September 2]] [[1945]].
There are several main [[Causes of World War II|causes of this conflict]], most important being unforeseen consequences of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which ended [[World War I]], and of the [[Great Depression]], the worldwide economic disaster gave rise to [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]]. The lead-up to the war stretches back to [[Events preceding World War II in Europe|build-ups and smaller regional wars]] of the [[1930]]s, which slowly drew in more countries and culminated in massive battles with millions of combatants in the first half of the [[1940s]].
Fighting occurred across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]] in and around eastern and western [[Europe]], in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] as well as across the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] in the [[Pacific]], in [[Oceania]] and across much of [[East Asia]] and [[South East Asia]].
It was the first war in which air power was a significant factor and [[civilian]] suffering and terror a primary military strategy. The war [[list of World War II casualties by country|caused more casualties than any war in history]]. This was partly due to its unprecedented scale, the first uses of mass aerial bombings against civilian populations (a policy initiated by the German [[Luftwaffe]] against Poland and later used more extensively against German cities by the Allies), and the first application of industrial-age technology to enable the mass killing of unwanted civilians in [[extermination camp]]s; a significant part of the German war machine was diverted towards the execution of [[Jew]]s, [[Roma]], [[Slavs]] and other unwanted citizens in the [[Holocaust]]. In total, World War II caused the deaths of about two percent of the [[World population|population of the world]].
The war also saw the re-emergence of the United States from its [[isolationism]], the destruction and rebuilding of Germany and Japan into major industrial powers, the advent of the [[atomic bomb]], the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as global [[superpower]]s, closer integration of Europe in the form of a [[European Union]], the dissolution of the [[League of Nations]] and creation of the [[United Nations]], founded by the victorious Allies in order to prevent such a large and destructive conflict from ever happening again.
The post-war period set the stage for the [[Cold War]], with the [[Western Allies]] and most of [[Western Europe]] including [[West German]]y, [[Italy]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] forming [[NATO]], and the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Eastern Europe]] [[Satellite states|satellite]]s creating the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The struggle for dominance between these two alliances would last until the collapse of the Soviet Union in [[1991]].
==Participants==
''Main article: [[Participants in World War II]]''
Traditionally, the war is described as a conflict between two groups of powers: the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] and the [[Allies]]. The primary members of the Allies were the [[British Commonwealth]], the [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Axis primarily consisted of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy]], and the [[Empire of Japan]].
In reality, this network of alliances changed over time, with divisions within countries, shifts in alliances, and questionable practices by supposedly neutral countries. Countries that highlight complication with the Allied&ndash;Axis categorization include:
* [[France]], which was Allied at the start of the war, but was later divided into [[Vichy France]] and a German occupational government, with the [[Free French Forces]] controlling some French colonies;
* [[Italy]], where the association with Nazi Germany remained controversial and tentative until the German conquest of France, and which later surrendered to and joined the Allies following its invasion by Allied forces;
* The [[Soviet Union]], which actively participated in the invasion of [[Poland]] in a partnership with Nazi Germany, and extended its territory in [[the Baltics]] with German approval, but joined the Allies following an invasion by Nazi Germany in June [[1941]] which broke the [[Molotow-Ribbentrop Pact]] between them;
* [[Finland]], which initially received Allied sympathy, and some support, while defending itself from the Soviet invasion of the [[Winter War]] &mdash; a sympathy that diminished starkly after the aforementioned invasion of the Soviet Union, when the Red Army in the [[Continuation War]] attacked Finland again. In this conflict, Finland's northern part was defended by German forces, and Britain, but not the United States, [[declaration of war|declared war]] on Finland in support of the Soviet action.
In addition, many countries, although avowedly neutral, provided military volunteers and other support either to the Allies or to the Axis. For example, [[Spain]] supplied [[Blue Division|troops]] for use by Germany.
==Causes==
''Main article: [[Causes of World War II]]''
The Second World War originated from a variety of causes. Some of the most commonly mentioned include the aggressive rise of [[totalitarian]] [[ideology|ideologies]], and, from a narrower perspective, [[war reparation]]s demanded of Germany after [[World War I]], coupled with the effects of the [[Great Depression]] and the lack of raw materials in Japan.
The [[economic depression]] and [[inflation]] of these latter nations' [[currency]] contributed to the rise of [[facism|fascist]] ideals and fervent [[nationalism]], which, in turn, led to the [[militarism|militarization]] of the economy and mobilization of forces along key borders in these nations. With the rise of fascism, the foreign policies of the Axis nations became more aggressive and strained the Allied leadership.
==Prelude to War==
''Main article: [[Events preceding World War II in Europe]], [[Events preceding World War II in Asia]]''
Resentment of the victorious [[Power (international)|powers]]' treatment of the [[Weimar Republic]] in the [[aftermath of World War I]] and economic difficulties caused by [[war reparation]]s and the Great Depression allowed [[Adolf Hitler]]'s extreme [[nationalist]] [[NSDAP]] movement to come to power in Germany. Due to the fragile political situation, Hitler was able to assume emergency powers and virtual total control of the country.
Defying post-WWI treaties, he re-developed the German military by means of the democratic constitution that was later put aside. He re-militarised the border zone next to France, enforced the re-unification with [[Austria]] in the so-called [[Anschluss]], and with Franco-British approval he annexed parts of [[Czechoslovakia]].
In [[1922]] [[Benito Mussolini]] and the [[Fascist]] party had risen to power in Italy. Mussolini's Italian fascists shared some ideological goals with the German [[National Socialist]]s or Nazis and, although Mussolini distrusted Hitler, the two countries formed an agreement that became known as the "Rome-Berlin Axis" in 1936.
In the east, [[Japan]] had, as early as the late nineteenth century, begun to spread out across Asia, brought about by conflict between traditional Japanese practices and changing social conditions associated with rapid [[industrialization|industrialisation]] and [[modernization|modernisation]]. In [[1905]] Japan won an astounding victory over [[Russia]], and in [[1910]] it occupied [[Korea]] and made it a colony.
During the [[1920s]] democracy seemed to be taking root in Japan, but by
the [[1930s]], the [[Great Depression]] brought to the fore many talented military leaders who took control of Japan, often ruling in the name of Emperor [[Hirohito]], and playing on the traditional respect the Japanese people held for their emperors. In [[1931]], Japan invaded and occupied [[Inner Manchuria]], setting up the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]], and by [[1937]] launched a second invasion that occupied the rest of the region. For this reason, some scholars consider 1936/37 the actual start of World War II.
== European Theatre ==
''Main article: [[European Theatre of World War II]], [[The end of World War II in Europe]]''
In [[1939]], Hitler laid claim to parts of [[Poland]] and concluded the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]] in response to Britain's and France's supportive defence alliance with Poland of March 1939.
The German [[Wehrmacht]] then [[Polish September Campaign|invaded Poland]] on [[1 September]], and on [[3 September]] [[1939]], Britain and France declared war on Germany (''[[Media:Chamberlain-war-declaration.mp3|Listen to Neville Chamberlain declaring war on Germany]] (MP3, 1.32MB)''), however neither French nor British troops [[Western_betrayal#The_Phony_War|gave any significant assistance to the Poles]] during the entire September Campaign.
On [[17 September]] the Soviet [[Red Army]] joined the invasion, and, hours after that, the [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish government]] [[Romanian Bridgehead|evacuated the country for Romania]]. Hostilities in Poland ended on [[6 October]] with the final [[Battle of Kock (1939)|Battle of Kock]]. Over the following months [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poland managed to rebuild its armies]] in France and Britain and remained an important combatant throughout the entire war.
In October ''[[Unterseeboot 47|U-47]]'' sank [[HMS Royal Oak|HMS ''Royal Oak'']] in [[Scapa Flow]] and the [[Luftwaffe]] carried out bombing raids on British naval bases at [[Rosyth]] and [[Scapa Flow]].
In December [[1939]], the German [[pocket battleship]] [[Admiral Graf Spee]] engaged British naval forces in the [[Battle of the River Plate]] in South America. The German warship retreated into [[Montevideo]] harbour and was scuttled shortly thereafter.
The period from the conclusion of the invasion of Poland in October 1939 until the German invasion of the [[Benelux]] countries and [[France]] in May 1940, became known as the ''[[Phony War]]''. The German and Soviet forces were moved from the attack on Poland. The Red Army concentrated on the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] countries and on [[Finland]], where the [[Winter War]] became a focus of the world's interest in the absence of other hostilities.
Meanwhile, the Wehrmacht moved north and invaded Denmark and Norway in [[Operation Weserübung]]. France mobilised and manned its heavily-defended border (The [[Maginot Line]]) against the [[Rhine]] and the British sent a large expeditionary force to France. However, apart from a brief attack by the French across the Rhine, there were little in the way of hostilities as both sides built up their forces.
In May of 1940 German forces attacked the [[Low Countries]] ([[The Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]). The three countries were occupied quickly, all of their governments and monarchs fleeing to [[London]], except for the Belgian king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] who stayed in his country.
[[France]] was then invaded via the Low Countries, bypassing the Maginot Line. The Germans' [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics succeeded in defeating the French and British armies in France. The [[British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) evacuated from [[Dunkirk]] in [[Operation Dynamo]], leaving their heavy equipment and their French allies behind. When German tanks overran most of France, the French State collapsed and a new government made a peace, leaving the Germans in control of the North and the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] in (nominal) charge of the South.
The [[Luftwaffe]] was unable to defeat the [[Royal Air Force]] in the [[Battle of Britain]] and gain the air superiority needed to invade Britain. Instead, they began a [[strategic bombing]] campaign, which the British called [[the Blitz]], and attempted to blockade Britain into submission in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1940)|Battle of the Atlantic]]. Britain failed to succumb to either tactic.
Meanwhile the geography of the Europe was changed: Soviet Union occupied [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]] (June, [[1940]]), and annexed [[Bessarabia]] and Northern [[Bukovina]] from [[Romania]] ([[June 28]] [[1940]]).
[[Italy]] attacked [[Greece]] on October 28 1940 and suffered the first [[Axis]] defeat. Though [[Hitler]] had no plans for Greece at that time, he was forced to send troops to occupy Greece (since Greece's [[neutral country|neutrality]] was broken) on April of 1941. This resulted in the delay of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and the loss of precious troops (see the [[Battle of Crete]]).
In June 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union, with whom they had previously signed a [[non-aggression pact]], starting what is known in Russia as the [[Great Patriotic War]] ([[Russian language|ru]]:, ''Velikaya Otechestvennaya Voyna''). The Russians were caught largely by surprise and the Wehrmacht initially conquered vast areas of territory, capturing hundreds of thousands of troops.
The Soviets withdrew, and managed to move most of their heavy industry away from the front line and re-establish it in more remote areas. Tenacious, sacrificial defence prevented the Germans from capturing [[Moscow]] ([[Hero City]]) by the time winter set in (see [[Battle of Moscow]]). Hitler, expecting the campaign to be over in a few months, had not equipped their armies for winter fighting.
Five days after the Soviets launched their counter-attack on [[December 11]], [[1941]], Germany declared war on the United States following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] by [[Japan]] - see [[World_War_II#Asian_Theatre|Asian Theatre]].
In spring, the German army made further attacks on the Soviet Union but appeared to be unable to choose between a direct attack on [[Moscow]] and the capture of the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] oilfields. Moscow was again spared and, at the end of 1942, the Soviets succeeded in smashing the Axis' front lines in the south and surrounding the German 6th Army, originally comprised of 300,000 men, in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] ([[Hero City]]).
In February 1943, the paltry remnant of the 6th Army surrendered. The loss could have been avoided had Hitler taken Stalingrad when it was devoid of Soviet troops; however, he mistakenly believed it was too well defended. In retrospect, Goebbels' [[Sportpalast speech]] marks their recognition that [[total war]] was a necessary response to the Allies' advances.
In the spring, the Wehrmacht was able to restore the front line and make a successful riposte in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]] but their offensive at the massive [[Battle of Kursk]] (July 1943) was so unsuccessful that the Red Army were able to counterattack and regain the ground previously lost.
From that time forward, the Soviet Union had the initiative in the East. By early 1944, the Red Army had reached the border of Poland and ended the [[Siege of Leningrad]].
The German disaster at Stalingrad was promptly followed by a disaster of similar importance in Tunisia (see [[World War II#African and Middle Eastern Theatre|African theatre]] below), resulting in the loss of the last Axis foothold in North Africa and the capture of a quarter of a million German and Italian [[POW]]s (May 1943).
Thereafter, the Allies used North Africa as a springboard for the [[Operation Husky|invasion of Sicily]] (July 1943) and [[Allied invasion of Italy|mainland Italy]] (September 1943), which [[Winston Churchill]] described as "the soft underbelly of Europe".
Italy surrendered but German troops moved to disarm the Italians and set about defending the country on their own. They established a series of tough defensive lines in mountainous country that was ideally suited to defence and progress by the Allies was slow.
The Allies invaded [[Normandy]] in [[Operation Overlord]] on [[June 6]] [[1944]] and liberated most of France and the Low Countries by the end of the year.
On [[June 9]], the Soviet Union began an offensive on the [[Karelian Isthmus]], forcing German co-belligerent Finland out of the war. On [[June 22]], the Soviets began [[Operation Bagration]]; 2.5 million men and 6,000 tanks attacked along a 1,000-kilometre front, completely destroying the 500,000-man German [[Army Group Centre]] and taking 350,000 prisoners.
Romania surrendered in August and Bulgaria on September. The Germans withdrew from Balkans and managed to hold their position in Hungary until February 1945.
After a desperate counteroffensive by the German army in the Ardennes during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944, the Allies entered Germany in [[1945]]. By now, the Soviets had reached the eastern borders of the German [[Reich]] and her fate was sealed.
The Red Army captured [[Vienna]] on [[April 14]] and the final assault on Berlin began on [[April 16]]. As the Russians surrounded [[Berlin]], Hitler and his staff moved into the bunker underneath the Chancellery. There, on [[30 April]] [[1945]], Adolf Hitler committed suicide as Russian shells exploded in the Chancellery garden above.
It had been twelve years and three months since the time he had become dictator of Germany. He had appointed Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] President of Germany prior to his suicide but, one week later, the German armed forces surrendered unconditionally on [[8 May]] [[1945]] (the documents were signed on [[7 May]] and the surrender to Soviet forces occurred on [[9 May]]).
Throughout the period of the war, [[Ireland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[Sweden]] remained officially [[neutral country|neutral]]. In Ireland, the conflict is referred to as [[The Emergency]].
== Pacific Theatre ==
''Main article: [[Pacific War]]''
In 1940, Japan occupied French Indochina (Vietnam) upon agreement with the [[Vichy Government]] and despite local Free French, and joined the Axis powers Germany and Italy. These actions intensified Japan's conflict with the United States and the United Kingdom which reacted with an oil boycott.
The Japanese had already invaded [[China]] before World War II started in Europe. U.S. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] signed an executive order in May of 1940 allowing U.S. military personnel to resign from the service so that they could participate in a covert operation in China. Hence was born the All Volunteer Group, more commonly known as Chennault's [[Flying Tigers]]. With the United States and other countries cutting exports to Japan, Japan decided to [[attack on Pearl Harbor|bomb Pearl Harbor]] on [[7 December]] [[1941]] without warning or declaration of war. Severe damage was done to the American [[Pacific Fleet]], although the [[aircraft carrier]]s escaped as they were at sea. Japanese forces simultaneously invaded the British possessions of [[Malaya]] and [[Borneo]] and the American occupied [[Philippines]], with the intention of seizing the oilfields of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The British island fortress of [[Singapore]] was captured in what Churchill considered one of the most humiliating British defeats of all time.
In May 1942, the Allied navies in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] thwarted a Japanese naval attack on [[Port Moresby]], [[New Guinea]] which had it succeeded would have put them within striking range of [[Australia]]. This was both the first successful opposition to Japanese plans and the first naval battle fought only between aircraft carriers. A month later the U.S. Navy again prevented the invasion of [[Battle of Midway|Midway Island]], this time destroying four Japanese carriers, which Japanese industry could not replace, and putting the Japanese navy on the defensive.
However, in July the Japanese Army attempted an overland attack on Port Moresby, along the rugged [[Kokoda Track]]. Australian reservists, many of them very young and untrained, fought a stubborn rearguard action, until they were relieved by Australian regular troops returning from action in the [[Middle East]].
The Allied leaders had agreed even prior to the American entry to the war that priority should be given to the defeat of Germany. Nonetheless US and Australian forces under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] began to attack captured territories, beginning with, against the bitter and determined defence of Japanese troops, [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal Island]]. On [[7 August]] [[1942]] the island was assaulted by [[United States Marines]]. In late August and early September, while battle raged on Guadalcanal, Australian forces fought off a Japanese amphibious attack on the eastern tip of New Guinea at [[Battle of Milne Bay|Milne Bay]], the first conclusive defeat suffered by Japanese land forces. US forces triumphed on Guadalcanal in February 1943.
Exhausted Australian and US forces then strove to retake the occupied parts of [[New Guinea]] and the Dutch East Indies, experiencing some of the toughest resistance of the Pacific Theatre. The rest of the [[Solomon Islands]] were retaken in 1943, [[New Britain]] and [[New Ireland]] in 1944. The Philippines were attacked in late 1944 following the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].
US and Allied submarines and aircraft also attacked Japanese merchant shipping, depriving Japanese industry of the raw materials she had gone to war to obtain. The effectiveness of this stranglehold increased as the U.S. captured islands closer to the Japanese mainland.
The Nationalist [[Kuomintang]] Army under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] Chinese Army under [[Mao Zedong]] both opposed the Japanese occupation of China, but never truly allied against the Japanese. Conflict between Nationalist and Communist forces continued after and, to an extent, even during the war.
Capture by the Allies of islands such as [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] close to Japan brought the homeland within range of naval and air attacks, [[Tokyo]] was firebombed and later an [[atomic bomb]], the "Little Boy", was dropped from the B-29 "Enola Gay" and destroyed [[Hiroshima]]. On [[8 August]] [[1945]] the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, as had been agreed to at Yalta, and launched a large scale invasion of Japanese occupied Manchuria (operation [[August Storm]]). On [[August 9]], in [[Nagasaki]], another atom bomb, "Fat Man" was dropped by the B-29 "Bock's Car". The Japanese surrendered on [[14 August]] [[1945]], signing official surrender papers on [[2 September]] [[1945]] aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.
== African and Middle Eastern Theatre ==
The [[North African Campaign]] began in [[1940]], when small British forces in [[Egypt]] turned back an Italian advance from [[Libya]]. This advance was stopped in [[1941]] when German forces under [[Erwin Rommel]] landed in Libya. In addition, in [[June]] [[1941]] the [[Australian Army]] and allied forces invaded [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], capturing [[Damascus]] on [[17 June]]. Rommel's [[Afrika Korps]] advanced rapidly eastward, laying siege to the vital seaport of [[Tobruk]]. The Australian and British troops in the city resisted all until relieved, but a renewed Axis offensive captured the city and drove the Eighth Army back to a line at [[El Alamein]].
The [[First Battle of El Alamein]] took place between [[July 1]] and [[July 27]], [[1942]]. German forces had advanced to the last defensible point before [[Alexandria]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. However they had outrun their supplies, and a British and Commonwealth defence stopped their thrusts. The [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] occurred between [[October 23]] and [[November 3]], [[1942]] after [[Bernard Montgomery]] had replaced [[Claude Auchinleck]] as commander of the Eighth Army. Commonwealth forces took the offensive and destroyed the Afrika Korps. Rommel was pushed back, and this time did not stop falling back until [[Tunisia]].
To complement this victory, on [[8 November]] [[1942]], American and British troops landed in [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] in [[Operation Torch]]. The local forces of [[Vichy France]] put up limited resistance before joining the Allied cause. Ultimately German and Italian forces were caught in the pincers of a twin advance from [[Algeria]] and Libya. Advancing from both the east and west, the Allies completely pushed the Wehrmacht out of [[Africa]] and on [[May 13]], [[1943]], the remnants of the Axis forces in North Africa surrendered. 250,000 prisoners were taken; as many as at [[Stalingrad]].
North Africa was used as the jumping-off point for the invasions of [[Sicily]] and mainland [[Italy]] in 1943.
==Consequences==
In contrast to [[World War I]], the Western victors in the Second World War did not demand compensation from the defeated nations. On the contrary, a plan created by U. S. Secretary of State [[George Marshall]], the "European Recovery Program", better known as the [[Marshall Plan]], called for the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] to allocate billions of dollars for the reconstruction of [[Europe]]. Also as part of the effort to rebuild global capitalism and spur post-war reconstruction, the [[Bretton Woods system]] was put into effect after the war.
Since the [[League of Nations]] had obviously failed to prevent the war, a new international order was constructed. In 1945 the [[United Nations]] was founded. Also, in order to prevent such devastating war from occurring again and to establish a lasting peace in Europe, the [[ECSC|European Coal and Steel Community]] was born in 1951 ([[Treaty of Paris (1951)]]), which became the predecessor of the [[European Union]].
The future [[Warsaw Pact]] countries did not subscribe to the Marshall Plan. In the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]], the Soviet Union's enemies [[Hungary]], [[Finland]] and [[Romania]] were required to pay [[war reparations]] of $300,000,000 each (in 1938 dollars) to the USSR. [[Italy]] was required to pay $360,000,000, shared chiefly between [[Greece]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the Soviet Union.
In the areas occupied by Western Allied troops, capitalist governments were created, in the areas occupied by Soviet troops, communist governments were created. Germany was partitioned into four zones of occupation, with the American, British and French zones grouped as [[West Germany]] and the Soviet zone as [[East Germany]]. [[Austria]] was once again separated from Germany and it, too, was divided into four zones of occupation which eventually re-united and became the state of Austria. The [[Cold War]] had begun, and soon [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] would form.
The repatriation, pursuant to the terms of the [[Yalta Conference]], of two million Russian soldiers who had come under the control of advancing American and British forces, resulted for the most part in their deaths.
The massive research and development involved in the [[Manhattan Project]] in order to quickly achieve a working [[nuclear weapon design]] greatly impacted the scientific community, among other things creating a network of national laboratories in the United States. In addition, the pressing for numerous calculations for various things like [[Colossus computer|code breaking]] and ballistics tables kickstarted the development of electronic [[computer]] technology.
In the military sphere, World War II marked the coming of age of airpower, mostly at the expense of warships. While the pendulum continues to swing in this never-ending competition, air powers are now a full partner in any military action. World War II also saw the creation of [[guided missile]]s which, like airpower, are now used in virtually every conflict.
The war was the high-water mark for mass armies. While huge armies of low-quality troops would be seen again (during the [[Korean War]] and in a number of African conflicts), after this victory the major powers relied upon small highly-trained and well-equipped militaries.
After the war, many high-ranking Germans were prosecuted for [[war crime]]s, as well as the mass murder of the [[Holocaust]] committed mainly on the area of [[General Government]], in the [[Nuremberg trials]]. Similarly Japanese leaders were prosecuted in the [[Tokyo War Crime Trial]]. Although the deliberate targeting of civilians was already defined as a war crime and it had been used extensively by both sides, most notably in Poland, Britain, Germany and Japan, those responsible were never tried for it. In other countries, notably in Finland, the Allies demanded the political leadership to be prosecuted in "[[war-responsibility trials]]" &mdash; i.e. not for ''crimes'' of war.
The defeat of Japan, and her occupation by American Forces, led to a [[westernization]] of Japan that was surely more far-reaching than would otherwise have occurred. Japan approximated more closely to a Western style democracy and, because of her defeat by the USA, set out to imitate the United States. This huge national effort led to the post-war Japanese economic miracle and Japan's rise to become the world's second largest economy.
The destruction of Europe and the destruction, via aerial bombing, of a significant proportion of the United Kingdom's cities would also symbolically destroy the aura of invincibility the European nation had in the eyes of their colonies. Coupled with the enormous amount of money it had expended during the war, an empire was perceived to be an unnecessarily expensive possession. Thus this would provoke the rapid [[decolonisation]] process that would see the empires of the United Kingdom, France and others swept away.

== Production and logistics ==
The Axis lost, at least partly because the Allies, after the USA's and the Soviet Union's entrance into the war, had greater productive resources, and were able to turn these resources into greater numbers of soldiers and weapons than the Axis. This was further compounded by the comparative lack of equipment standardization among the Axis forces and its failure to use its large territorial (and associated resources) gains in an economy on war footing. For instance Germany was the only war economy which largely didn't make use of the labour of women.

Java is an object-oriented programming language developed initially by James Gosling and colleagues at Sun Microsystems. It was intended to replace C++, although the feature set better resembles that of Objective-C. Sun Microsystems currently maintains and updates Java regularly. Specifications of the Java language, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the Java API are community-maintained through the Sun-managed Java Community Process. Java was developed in 1991 by Gosling and other Sun engineers, as part of the Green Project. After first being made public in 1994, it achieved prominence following the announcement at 1995's SunWorld that Netscape would be including support for it in their Navigator browser.

The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the opening into the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. The entire bridge including the approach spans is 1.7 miles (2,727 m) long, whilst the main span between the towers is 4200 feet (1280 m). The two towers rise 746 feet (230 m) above the water. From its completion in 1937, the center span was the longest among suspension bridges until 1964 when the Verrazano Narrows Bridge was erected.
